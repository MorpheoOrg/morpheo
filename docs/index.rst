Welcome to Morpheo's doc!
=========================

Morpheo is an open source platform to provide an intelligent detection of patterns and pathologies in sleep physiological recordings while guaranteeing advanced data privacy and full transparency. 

While it is first applied to sleep physiological recording, it could be used with any sensitive data.  
Check the `Morpheo website`_ and the `White Paper`_ for high level documentation. 

This website gathers all technical documentation of the Morpheo platform.
